<div class="bg-secondary-bg rounded px-6 py-6">

I have experience with multiple cloud providers including AWS, GCP and Azure.

I made audits, cost- and performance optimization, migrations, and operations in the Cloud.

I worked with cloud providers' professional technology teams, and I have an AWS Developer Associate certification.

Some cloud providers and their services I have experience with:

- AWS
  - EC2
  - ECS (Container Services) - even with Fargate

  - RDS
  - S3
  - DynamoDB
  - CloudFront

  - CloudWatch
  - Lambda
  - etc...

- GCP
  - GCE (Compute Engine)
  - GKE (Kubernetes)
  - Cloud Storage
  - Cloud SQL
