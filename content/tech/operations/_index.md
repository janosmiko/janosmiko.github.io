<div class="bg-secondary-bg rounded px-6 py-6">

I believe that everything should be automated and written as code. 

<!--more-->
<br>

I use the following tools to write down the infrastructure as code and the configurations as code:

- Terraform
- Ansible

<br>

As a DevOps engineer I have operated a lot of services and systems in the past. Some examples:

- Nginx
- Caddy
- Apache HTTPD
- Tomcat
- PHP-FPM
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) - with HA configurations (Galera, XtraDB Cluster)
- Redis - with HA configurations using Sentinel
- RabbitMQ
- Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK)
- Prometheus, Grafana
- Mercure
- and so on...
