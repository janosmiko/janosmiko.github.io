## Introduction

Welcome to my site!

Let me introduce myself: I'm János Mikó.

I have always loved technology. I work as a Lead DevOps Engineer and Go developer for nearly 10 years.

It sounds sentimental, but the "cloud" is where I feel at home.


### Some Personal Stuff

- I prefer Everything as Code methodology. When I need to do something twice, I'll try to automate it.
- I manage my work and my life using GTD and OKR.
- I follow stoic philosophy.
- I meditate daily.
- I am a proud dad of 2 dachshunds.
