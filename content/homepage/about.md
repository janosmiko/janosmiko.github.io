## Introduction

I'm Janos Miko, a DevOps Engineer and Go developer with more than a decade of
experience in cloud infrastructure and automation.

My passion for technology drives me to build scalable, reliable systems that
solve real-world problems.

I specialize in cloud-native architectures, infrastructure automation, and
building developer-focused tools.

The cloud isn't just where I work - it's where I thrive.

### Philosophy & Interests

- **Everything as Code advocate**: Automating repetitive tasks and treating
infrastructure, configuration, and processes as code.
- **Productivity**: Leveraging GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology and OKRs
(Objectives and Key Results) to manage both professional and personal projects.
- **Philosophy**: Applying stoic principles to maintain focus, resilience,
and clear thinking.
- **Mental Well-being**: I practice daily meditation to maintain clarity and
balance.
- **Beyond Coding**: Hiking, biking, reading, podcasts, e-books and enjoying
life as a dad of two dachshunds and a little boy.
