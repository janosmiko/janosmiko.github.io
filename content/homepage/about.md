## Introduction

Welcome to my site!

Let me introduce myself: I'm János Mikó.

I always loved the technology, I work as an enterprise Cloud / DevOps engineer and software developer since nearly 10 years.

It sounds sentimental, but the "cloud" is where I really feel at home.


### Some Personal Stuff

- I prefer Everything as Code methodology.
- I manage my work, and my life using GTD.
- I am a perfectionist.
- I meditate daily.
